- Epic 2: Research (Weeks 4-6)  
- Epic 3: Visualization (Weeks 7-9)
- Epic 4: CLI Integration (Weeks 10-11)
- Validation gates between phases

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues (All Resolved)

#### 5. Error Recovery Workflows âœ… RESOLVED
**Issue**: Missing error handling details
**Resolution**: Created `error-recovery-workflows.md` with:
- 8 detailed error scenarios
- Recovery workflows for each scenario
- Code implementations
- User notification standards
- Testing strategies

#### 6. User Onboarding Experience âœ… RESOLVED
**Issue**: Onboarding flow details missing
**Resolution**: Created `user-onboarding-experience.md` with:
- 10-minute onboarding flow
- Stage-by-stage walkthrough
- Interactive tutorial design
- CLI and GUI onboarding paths
- Success metrics and tracking

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Begin Epic 1 Development** (Week 1)
   - Start with US-1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup
   - Set up development environment
   - Initialize repository structure

2. **Team Alignment**
   - Review all documentation with development team
   - Confirm understanding of dependencies
   - Establish communication channels

3. **Development Setup**
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up testing framework
   - Establish code review process

### Week 1 Deliverables
- Docker environment running
- Basic FastAPI + React setup
- Database schema implemented
- First user story completed

## Risk Monitoring

### Remaining Risks to Monitor
1. **API Rate Limits**: Monitor NVD API availability
2. **Performance at Scale**: Test with 100-node limit early
3. **User Adoption**: Validate with beta users quickly

### Mitigation Strategies in Place
- Fallback mechanisms for all external dependencies
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Continuous user feedback loops

## Conclusion

The Hermes project has successfully addressed all critical feedback from the PO validation:

âœ… **User stories created** - 20+ detailed stories with full specifications
