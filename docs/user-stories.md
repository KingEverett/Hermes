## Cross-Epic Integration Points

### Data Flow Dependencies

```yaml
integration_points:
  epic_1_to_2:
    - parsed_scan_data: "Epic 1 provides structured data for Epic 2 enrichment"
    - data_models: "Epic 2 extends Epic 1 models with vulnerability fields"
    
  epic_2_to_3:
    - enriched_data: "Epic 3 visualizes Epic 2's vulnerability research"
    - severity_scores: "Epic 3 uses Epic 2's CVSS for color coding"
    
  epic_3_to_4:
    - ui_components: "Epic 4 may reuse Epic 3's display logic"
    - export_formats: "Epic 4 leverages Epic 3's export capabilities"
```

### Technical Integration Requirements

1. **Shared Data Models** (Epic 1 → All)
   - Common SQLAlchemy models
   - Consistent API contracts
   - Shared validation logic

2. **Service Communication** (Epic 2 → 3)
   - WebSocket updates for research progress
   - Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

3. **Export Pipeline** (Epic 3 → 4)
   - Common export service
   - Shared formatting logic

## MVP Scope Refinement

### Core MVP Features (Must Have)

1. **Epic 1**: All stories (US-1.1 through US-1.4)
2. **Epic 2**: US-2.1, US-2.2, US-2.3 (simplified)
3. **Epic 3**: US-3.1 (simplified), US-3.3
4. **Epic 4**: US-4.1 only

### Deferred to Post-MVP

1. **Advanced Visualization**: 500-node support, complex filtering
2. **Multiple Export Formats**: SVG, advanced layouts
3. **CLI Advanced Features**: Piping, directory monitoring
4. **Complex Integrations**: Tool wrappers, batch processing

### Simplifications for MVP

1. **Network Graph**: 100 nodes max (vs 500)
2. **Export**: PNG only (vs SVG + PNG)
3. **CLI**: Basic import/export (vs full pipeline)
4. **Research**: Manual links primary (vs full automation)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

1. **Performance at Scale**
   - Mitigation: Start with 100-node limit, optimize later
   - Fallback: Pagination and filtering

2. **API Rate Limits**
   - Mitigation: Aggressive caching, manual link fallbacks
   - Fallback: Offline mode with manual research

3. **Cross-Epic Integration**
   - Mitigation: Clear API contracts, integration tests
   - Fallback: Modular design allows independent operation

### Schedule Risks

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict MVP scope enforcement
   - Regular scope reviews

2. **Dependency Delays**
   - Mitigation: Sequential epic execution
   - Buffer time between epics

## Success Metrics

### MVP Launch Criteria

- [ ] Parse nmap scans and generate markdown (Epic 1)
- [ ] Basic vulnerability detection working (Epic 2)
- [ ] Simple network graph displays (Epic 3)
- [ ] CLI import/export functional (Epic 4)
- [ ] Performance: 100-host scan in 15 seconds

### Post-MVP Roadmap

1. **Phase 2**: Advanced visualization, full CLI integration
2. **Phase 3**: Team collaboration features
3. **Phase 4**: Enterprise features, API marketplace
