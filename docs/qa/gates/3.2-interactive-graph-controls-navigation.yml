# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Low risk visualization feature. No XSS vulnerabilities, no user input fields, React's built-in protections in place. No authentication/authorization required for client-side feature."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent optimization for large graphs (500+ nodes tested). Alpha decay tuning, simulation tick limits, useCallback memoization, proper cleanup. Smooth transitions with appropriate durations (300-750ms)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error prevention with proper cleanup (simulation.stop, event listener removal, touch timer cleanup). Ref safety checks before DOM operations. Graceful empty state handling."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive JSDoc comments, strong TypeScript typing, excellent separation of concerns (store/hooks/components), self-documenting code with clear variable names. Production-ready architecture."
  usability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent UX with comprehensive visual feedback (selection badge, zoom percentage, tooltips, keyboard shortcuts legend). Full accessibility support (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, WCAG 2.1 compliant)."

  future:
    - action: "Add optional debug mode with D3 transform logging for production troubleshooting"
      refs: ["frontend/web-app/src/components/visualization/NetworkGraph.tsx"]
      priority: "low"
      rationale: "Would aid debugging but not required for production"
    - action: "Consider extracting D3 force simulation config to separate configuration file for reusability"
      refs: ["frontend/web-app/src/components/visualization/NetworkGraph.tsx:230-236"]
      priority: "low"
      rationale: "Improves maintainability if multiple graph types are needed"
    - action: "Add haptic feedback for touch device selection (if browser support improves)"
      refs: ["frontend/web-app/src/components/visualization/NetworkGraph.tsx:363-380"]
      priority: "low"
      rationale: "Enhanced mobile UX when Vibration API becomes more widely supported"
