# Final gate decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  Story 3.4 receives a PASS gate decision with a quality score of 95/100.

  STRENGTHS:
  - All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented with excellent attention to detail
  - Professional-grade React architecture with proper separation of concerns
  - Comprehensive error handling and user experience considerations
  - Strong TypeScript usage with interfaces matching data models exactly
  - Excellent React Query integration with proper caching strategy
  - Dark theme styling perfectly consistent with Story 3.3
  - 8 custom hooks following consistent, reusable pattern
  - 8 detail components with proper loading/error/empty states
  - Security best practices followed (clipboard API, external links)

  MINOR CONCERNS (-5 points):
  - Toast notification system not yet implemented (TODO comment present)
  - 3 components lack dedicated unit tests (acceptable - integration tested)
  - Jest config needed for MDEditor ESM imports (resolved during QA)

  TECHNICAL DEBT: 3 low-priority items, ~5.5 hours total resolution time

  RECOMMENDATION: ✅ Ready for Done

  This implementation exceeds expectations and is production-ready. The minor
  technical debt items are acceptable for this sprint and should be addressed
  in future iterations. No blocking issues identified.

  Outstanding work on component architecture, user experience, and code quality!
