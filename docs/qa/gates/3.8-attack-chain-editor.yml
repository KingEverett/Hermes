# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper input validation (name min 3 chars, hex color regex). XSS prevention via React safe rendering. No dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage. Auth/authz handled at API layer."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimized React rendering with controlled components. @dnd-kit library is performant. Single PUT request on save. Suitable for typical chains (5-20 nodes). Virtual scrolling recommended for 50+ node chains (future optimization)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with loading/error states. Validation prevents invalid saves. Proper cleanup on component unmount. useEffect dependencies correctly set to prevent infinite loops."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality with full TypeScript coverage. Clear component structure with SortableNodeItem sub-component. Self-documenting code. Test-to-code ratio ~1.7:1. Follows established patterns from Story 3.6."

# Final assessment
assessment:
  overall_grade: "A (Excellent)"
  production_ready: true
  blocking_issues: 0
  concerns: 0
  strengths:
    - "Professional-grade component architecture with clear separation of concerns"
    - "Excellent state management preventing infinite loops (useEffect dependency on chainId)"
    - "Comprehensive test coverage at appropriate levels (unit + integration)"
    - "Full TypeScript type safety"
    - "Proper accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard support"
    - "Robust validation and error handling"
    - "Follows established patterns from Story 3.6 for consistency"
  observations:
    - "window.alert/confirm usage is functional but could be enhanced with toast system"
    - "Temporary ID generation could use crypto.randomUUID() for better uniqueness"
    - "All observations are minor and non-blocking"
