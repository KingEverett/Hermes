nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No vulnerabilities identified. Proper UUID validation, safe template rendering with Jinja2 escaping, no SQL injection risks, graceful error handling for missing entities."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent optimizations: entity caching prevents N+1 queries, eager loading via selectinload(), conditional rendering, efficient SVG generation. Estimated impact <100ms for typical projects, well within Story 1.4 performance budget."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling throughout. Empty list returned on fetch exceptions, fallback strings for missing entities, None returned on SVG failure. UUID conversion handled consistently. Graceful degradation when SVG generation fails."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code clarity with descriptive method names, comprehensive docstrings, type hints throughout. Well-documented with clear template structure. Easy to extend for additional chain properties or export formats."

architecture_review:
  patterns_followed:
    - "Repository pattern for data access (AttackChainRepository)"
    - "Service layer for business logic (DocumentationService)"
    - "Template pattern for rendering (Jinja2 markdown.j2)"
    - "API layer separation (exports.py with ExportRequest schema)"
  integration_quality: "Excellent - seamless integration with Story 1.4 DocumentationService and Story 3.6 AttackChain models"
  separation_of_concerns: "Clear separation: repository (data), service (logic), template (presentation), API (interface)"

performance_analysis:
  optimizations:
    - "Entity caching via _entity_cache dictionary"
    - "Eager loading of chain nodes with selectinload()"
    - "Conditional chain fetching based on include_attack_chains flag"
    - "Simple SVG generation avoiding complex rendering"
  estimated_overhead: "<100ms for typical projects with 10 chains"
  scalability: "Linear with number of chains and nodes, suitable for expected workload"

code_metrics:
  complexity: "Low to Medium - clear logic flow, well-decomposed methods"
  duplication: "None identified"
  documentation_quality: "Excellent - comprehensive docstrings with Args/Returns/Raises"
  type_safety: "Strong - type hints throughout service layer"
