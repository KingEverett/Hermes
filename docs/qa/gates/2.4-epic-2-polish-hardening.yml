nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API key auth properly implemented with clear error messages. Dev mode provides good DX. Acceptable for MVP internal use."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Performance validation deferred (Task 3 incomplete). Story 2.3 requires <5% overhead validation. Monitor in production."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "100% test pass rate. Comprehensive error handling. Redis bytes handling robust."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality. Helper methods (_ensure_uuid, _decode_redis_value) improve clarity. Route ordering well-documented."

test_architecture:
  coverage_adequacy: excellent
  test_design_quality: excellent
  edge_case_coverage: good
  test_maintainability: excellent
  notes: |
    - 13 comprehensive auth tests cover all scenarios
    - 45 job monitoring tests all passing after elegant fixes
    - Test dependency injection properly configured
    - Mock setup clean and maintainable

code_quality:
  architecture: excellent
  design_patterns: excellent
  refactoring_opportunities: minimal
  best_practices: excellent
  notes: |
    - Auth middleware follows FastAPI Security best practices
    - UUID type conversion centralized via helper methods
    - Redis deserialization isolated and reusable
    - Route ordering documented with clear comment
    - Pydantic v2 migration completed correctly

technical_debt:
  items:
    - description: "Performance overhead not validated (<5% requirement from Story 2.3)"
      severity: medium
      estimated_effort: "4-8 hours"
      impact: "Unknown if monitoring meets performance SLA"
    - description: "Task history cleanup not automated"
      severity: low
      estimated_effort: "2-4 hours"
      impact: "Database will grow unbounded over time"
    - description: "API key stored in plain text environment variable"
      severity: low
      estimated_effort: "1-2 hours for secrets manager integration"
      impact: "Acceptable for MVP, should use secrets manager for production"

strengths:
  - "Elegant solutions to complex test failures (UUID handling, Redis bytes, route ordering)"
  - "Comprehensive test coverage with 100% pass rate"
  - "Clean separation of concerns in auth middleware"
  - "Excellent code documentation and comments"
  - "Zero technical warnings or deprecations"
  - "Development mode provides excellent developer experience"
