notes: |
  This is the foundational story for the Hermes project. The infrastructure setup is well-executed
  with a proper monorepo structure and Docker containerization. All acceptance criteria have been
  met successfully. The identified improvements are minor and can be addressed incrementally
  without blocking progress on subsequent stories.
  
  The development team has demonstrated good understanding of the architecture requirements
  and has created a solid foundation for the application. The missing .env.example file should
  be created soon to improve developer onboarding experience.
