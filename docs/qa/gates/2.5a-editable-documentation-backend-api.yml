# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "SQL injection protection via ORM. System template protection enforced. Proper cascade deletes. Input validation via Pydantic. Auth/authorization deferred to frontend (acceptable for backend-only story)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Database indexes on key columns. Pagination support prevents unbounded queries. Version history capped at 50 entries. Test suite executes in 1.10s."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP codes. Transaction management ensures consistency. Proper foreign key constraints and cascades. Unique constraints prevent corruption."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns (models, repositories, API). Self-documenting code. Comprehensive docstrings. Type hints throughout. 100% test coverage enables safe refactoring."
