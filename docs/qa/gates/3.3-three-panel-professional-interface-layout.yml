  summary: |
    Comprehensive verification completed. All original concerns addressed with high-quality
    test coverage. Implementation demonstrates production-ready code with:
    - Complete responsive behavior validation
    - WCAG accessibility compliance documented and tested
    - Performance optimization (debouncing) verified
    - Integration scenarios covered
    - Bug fix applied and working

    This story exceeds quality expectations and sets a strong pattern for future work.
    The centralized types pattern and comprehensive test approach should be replicated.
