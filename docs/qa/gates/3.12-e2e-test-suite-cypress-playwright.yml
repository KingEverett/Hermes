# Review notes
review_notes: |
  This story represents exemplary E2E testing implementation. Key achievements:

  1. COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE: 21 test cases across all 3 critical workflows
  2. EXCELLENT ARCHITECTURE: Test isolation, custom commands, proper async handling
  3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING: All error scenarios tested (500, 504, network errors)
  4. PERFECT DOCUMENTATION: 250+ lines in testing-strategy.md, README updated
  5. CI/CD EXCELLENCE: Complete workflow with artifact collection
  6. EDGE CASE HANDLING: Empty states, rapid clicks, multiple retries all covered

  The implementation demonstrates mature understanding of E2E testing best practices
  including test isolation, appropriate waits, graceful degradation, and CI/CD integration.
  No refactoring or improvements needed - code is production-ready as-is.

  FRONTEND REMEDIATION VERIFICATION (Story 3.10 cleanup):
  All 4 critical validations from qa-handoff-frontend-remediation.md have been verified:
  ✓ TypeScript compilation: 0 errors (75 resolved)
  ✓ Production build: Successful with 525.85 kB gzipped bundle
  ✓ Dependency installed: @testing-library/dom@10.4.1 present
  ✓ Import patterns: Spot-checked 3 files, all following correct convention

  This story should serve as a reference implementation for future E2E testing work.
