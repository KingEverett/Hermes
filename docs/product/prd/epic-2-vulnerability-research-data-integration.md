# Epic 2: Vulnerability Research & Data Integration

**Epic Goal**: Implement automated background vulnerability research and API integrations that enrich parsed scan data with comprehensive security intelligence, while providing manual editing capabilities and research link options, eliminating the manual research tasks that consume 40-60% of penetration tester time and delivering the core value proposition that differentiates Hermes from existing tools.

## Story 2.1: Service Version Analysis and Vulnerability Indicators
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **reliable service version extraction and basic vulnerability flagging with confidence scoring**,
so that **potential vulnerabilities are identified accurately without overwhelming false positives**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. System extracts software versions from service banners using reliable parsing patterns
2. Version-based vulnerability flagging compares against known vulnerable version ranges
3. Default credential detection flags services with common default configurations
4. Confidence scoring (high/medium/low) provided for all vulnerability assessments
5. Manual review queue populated for uncertain matches requiring human validation
6. False positive rate remains under 10% with false negative tracking implemented
7. Analysis completes within 3 seconds per service with clear reasoning provided

## Story 2.2: API Configuration and Rate Limiting Infrastructure
As a **system administrator**,
I want **robust API key management and rate limiting framework**,
so that **research integrations are reliable and respect external service constraints**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Secure API key storage using OS keyring services with encryption at rest
2. Configurable rate limiting framework supports different API providers and limits
3. Comprehensive error handling for API failures, timeouts, and rate limit exceeded scenarios
4. User configuration interface for enabling/disabling specific research APIs
5. Fallback mechanisms when APIs unavailable with clear user notification
6. API usage monitoring and reporting for cost/quota management
7. Background job monitoring with failure recovery and retry mechanisms

## Story 2.3: NVD Integration with Robust Error Handling
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **automated NVD vulnerability research with reliable fallback options**,
so that **I have comprehensive CVE details when APIs are available and manual research links when they're not**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. NVD REST API v2.0 integration with 6-second rate limiting and exponential backoff
2. Redis caching system stores vulnerability data with configurable TTL (default 24 hours)
3. Background Celery tasks process research without blocking primary workflows
4. Research results include CVE description, CVSS score, and vendor advisory links
5. Manual research links generated for NVD search when API disabled or unavailable
6. Research completion within 60-90 seconds for typical vulnerability queries
7. Clear indication of research source (API vs cached vs manual link) in results

## Story 2.4: Exploit Database Integration with Validation
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **exploit discovery with validation and manual research options**,
so that **I can quickly assess exploitability through automated or manual research paths**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. ExploitDB integration searches for exploits based on service versions and CVEs
2. Exploit results include confidence validation and manual verification flags
3. Pre-formatted search links to ExploitDB, Metasploit, and Packet Storm when API unavailable
4. Exploit metadata categorized by platform, complexity, and reliability assessment
5. Manual exploit research workflow with note-taking capabilities for custom findings
6. Results prioritize verified, well-documented exploits with clear impact assessment
7. Exploit research completes within 60 seconds with graceful API failure handling

## Story 2.5: Editable Documentation with Manual Research Capabilities
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **fully editable markdown documentation with manual research note integration**,
so that **I can enhance automated findings with my own analysis and maintain complete control over documentation**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. In-line markdown editing capabilities for all generated documentation sections
2. Manual research notes can be added to any host, service, or vulnerability finding
3. User-added content clearly distinguished from automated research results
4. Version control for documentation changes with rollback capabilities
5. Rich text editor supports markdown syntax with live preview
6. Manual research templates for common investigation patterns and methodologies
7. Export capabilities preserve both automated and manual research contributions

## Story 2.6: Research Result Validation and Quality Control
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **research result validation with manual override capabilities**,
so that **I can trust automated findings while maintaining control over assessment conclusions**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Research confidence scoring system with clear validation criteria
2. Manual review queue for high-impact vulnerability findings requiring validation
3. Override capabilities for all automated research results with audit trail
4. Research result timestamping with staleness detection and refresh prompts
5. Quality control dashboard showing research accuracy metrics and trends
6. User feedback system for improving automated research accuracy over time
7. Manual validation workflow with standardized review criteria and approval process
