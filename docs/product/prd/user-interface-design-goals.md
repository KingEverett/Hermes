# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Hermes prioritizes a clean, professional interface that cybersecurity professionals can trust and deploy in enterprise environments. The design emphasizes information density without clutter, rapid access to detailed technical data, and seamless integration with existing pentesting workflows. The interface should feel familiar to users of professional security tools while providing the intelligent automation that sets Hermes apart.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Command-Line First Design**: UI complements rather than replaces CLI workflows, with full keyboard navigation and Vim-style shortcuts for power users
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex technical data presented through collapsible sections and drill-down interfaces, allowing users to control information depth
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback for scan processing, research status, and system operations to maintain workflow confidence
- **Context-Aware Panels**: Right sidebar dynamically updates with relevant vulnerability details, research results, and actionable information based on current selection

## Core Screens and Views

- **Main Dashboard**: Three-panel layout with network topology visualization as primary workspace, navigation sidebar, and contextual information panel
- **Scan Import Interface**: Drag-and-drop area with CLI command examples and real-time processing status
- **Host Detail View**: Comprehensive technical breakdown of individual hosts with tabbed organization for services, vulnerabilities, and research findings
- **Network Topology View**: Interactive graph visualization with zoom/pan controls, filtering options, and export capabilities
- **Settings and Configuration**: System configuration for API keys, scan directories, and user preferences with security-focused design

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The interface will meet WCAG AA standards to ensure accessibility in enterprise environments and government deployments where compliance is required.

## Branding

Professional cybersecurity aesthetic with dark theme as default (preferred by security professionals for extended use), high contrast ratios for readability, and minimal color palette focused on functional status indicators (red for critical vulnerabilities, yellow for warnings, green for secure services).

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop/laptop screens (1200px+) where penetration testing work occurs, with responsive design that gracefully handles smaller screens by collapsing panels and reorganizing content hierarchy.
