# Requirements

## Functional

- **FR1**: The system shall automatically parse nmap XML output (-oX), masscan JSON output, dirb/dirbuster plain text, and gobuster JSON into structured markdown nodes
- **FR2**: The system shall extract hosts, ports, services, banners, and vulnerability indicators from scan files within 15 seconds for 1000-host scans
- **FR3**: The system shall detect CVE patterns in service banners and identify default credential indicators automatically
- **FR4**: The system shall conduct background vulnerability research using NVD REST API v2.0, CISA KEV database, and ExploitDB search API
- **FR5**: The system shall provide CLI integration supporting `hermes import <file>`, `hermes monitor <directory>`, and `hermes pipe` for stdin processing
- **FR6**: The system shall generate interactive network topology visualization with clickable nodes revealing detailed findings
- **FR7**: The system shall provide three-panel interface with collapsible navigation, tabbed workspace, and contextual information panels
- **FR8**: The system shall automatically monitor configured directories for new scan files with real-time import capabilities
- **FR9**: The system shall detect and notify users of duplicate host entries, conflicting service information, and parsing errors
- **FR10**: The system shall export network topology as SVG for reports and PNG for presentations
- **FR11**: The system shall provide persistent data storage with SQLite for development and PostgreSQL option for production
- **FR12**: The system shall maintain configuration management for scan directories, API keys, and user preferences
- **FR13**: The system shall provide data recovery mechanisms when scan parsing encounters corrupted or partial files

## Non Functional

- **NFR1**: System shall process 1000-host nmap scan results within 15 seconds to maintain professional workflow pace
- **NFR2**: Network visualization shall support up to 500 nodes with responsive rendering under 2 seconds update time
- **NFR3**: Background research API calls shall complete within 30 seconds for common CVEs with graceful degradation when APIs unavailable
- **NFR4**: System memory usage shall remain under 512MB for typical pentesting project scope
- **NFR5**: All scan data shall remain local to user's infrastructure with no cloud dependencies for security compliance
- **NFR6**: API keys shall be stored locally with encryption at rest using OS keyring services
- **NFR7**: System shall respect NVD API rate limits with 6-second delays and implement Redis caching with 24-hour TTL
- **NFR8**: Interface shall be responsive with panels collapsing on screens under 1200px width
- **NFR9**: System shall provide full keyboard accessibility and Vim-style shortcuts for power users
- **NFR10**: Error rate for scan parsing failures and system errors shall remain below 2% to maintain professional tool credibility
