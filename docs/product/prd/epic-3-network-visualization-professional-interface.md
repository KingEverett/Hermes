# Epic 3: Network Visualization & Professional Interface

**Epic Goal**: Create interactive network topology visualization and professional three-panel interface that enables cybersecurity professionals to visually analyze infrastructure relationships, understand attack paths, and navigate complex network data efficiently while maintaining the professional aesthetic required for enterprise deployment.

## Story 3.1: Basic Network Graph Generation
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **automated generation of network topology graphs from parsed host and service data**,
so that **I can visualize infrastructure relationships and identify potential attack paths at a glance**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Graph generation creates nodes for each discovered host with IP address labels
2. Service nodes connected to hosts show port, protocol, and service type information
3. Force-directed layout algorithm positions nodes with logical spacing and minimal overlap
4. Graph supports up to 500 nodes with responsive rendering under 2 seconds
5. Color coding distinguishes host types (servers, workstations, network devices) by OS detection
6. Vulnerability indicators show severity levels through node border colors and icons
7. Graph data structure supports future filtering and search capabilities

## Story 3.2: Interactive Graph Controls and Navigation
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **zoom, pan, and selection controls for network topology exploration**,
so that **I can navigate large network infrastructures and focus on specific areas of interest**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Mouse wheel zoom functionality with smooth scaling transitions
2. Click-and-drag panning across entire graph area with momentum scrolling
3. Node selection highlights related connections and displays summary information
4. Multi-select capability for comparing multiple hosts or analyzing subnet groups
5. Fit-to-screen and reset view controls for quick navigation orientation
6. Keyboard shortcuts for common navigation actions (zoom in/out, reset, select all)
7. Touch-friendly controls for tablet and touchscreen deployment environments

## Story 3.3: Three-Panel Professional Interface Layout
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **professional three-panel interface with responsive design**,
so that **I have organized access to navigation, visualization, and detailed information simultaneously**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Left sidebar (200px) contains project navigation, scan history, and filtering controls
2. Center workspace (flexible width) displays network graph with tabbed interface options
3. Right sidebar (300px) shows contextual host details, vulnerability information, and research results
4. Panels collapse gracefully on screens under 1200px width with mobile-first design principles
5. Splitter controls allow users to resize panel widths for custom workspace preferences
6. Dark theme implementation with professional cybersecurity aesthetic and high contrast ratios
7. Panel state persistence maintains user layout preferences across sessions

## Story 3.4: Node Detail Views and Information Panels
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **detailed information panels for hosts and services with contextual data**,
so that **I can access comprehensive technical details without losing visual context of the network**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Host detail panel displays IP, hostname, OS, open ports, and vulnerability summary
2. Service detail view shows protocol, version, banner information, and related vulnerabilities
3. Tabbed organization separates technical details, vulnerability research, and manual notes
4. Quick-access buttons for common actions (add notes, mark reviewed, export data)
5. Cross-reference links show relationships to other hosts and shared vulnerabilities
6. Research status indicators display background research progress and completion
7. Detail panel updates dynamically as user selects different nodes without navigation lag

## Story 3.5: Graph Export and Documentation Integration
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **graph export capabilities and integration with markdown documentation**,
so that **I can include visual network analysis in professional assessment reports**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. SVG export functionality maintains vector quality for report inclusion and printing
2. PNG export with configurable resolution for presentations and documentation
3. Graph screenshots include legend, timestamps, and project metadata automatically
4. Integration with markdown documentation embeds graphs at appropriate sections
5. Export options include filtered views showing only specific vulnerability types or severities
6. Batch export capability for generating multiple network views with different filter settings
7. Export metadata includes scan sources, processing timestamps, and analysis annotations
