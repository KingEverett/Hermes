# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Intelligence Engine

**Epic Goal**: Establish the foundational project infrastructure and intelligent note-taking engine that automatically transforms nmap scan outputs into structured markdown documentation, delivering immediate time-savings value to cybersecurity professionals while providing the technical foundation for all subsequent features.

## Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup
As a **developer**,
I want **complete project scaffolding with Docker containerization and database setup**,
so that **the development environment supports all planned services and can be easily deployed**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo structure created with separate directories for frontend, backend, CLI, and shared components
2. Docker and docker-compose configuration supports Python backend, React frontend, Redis, and PostgreSQL services
3. SQLite database connection established for development with PostgreSQL migration path documented
4. Basic FastAPI application serves health check endpoint and returns JSON response
5. React TypeScript application renders basic "Hello Hermes" page with Tailwind CSS styling
6. All services start successfully with single `docker-compose up` command

## Story 1.2: Core Data Models and Schema
As a **developer**,
I want **database schema for hosts, services, vulnerabilities, and scan metadata**,
so that **parsed scan data can be persisted and queried efficiently**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Host entity model includes IP address, hostname, OS detection, and scan metadata
2. Service entity model includes port, protocol, service name, version, and banner information
3. Vulnerability entity model includes CVE identifier, severity, description, and research status
4. Scan entity model tracks scan source file, timestamp, tool type, and processing status
5. SQLAlchemy models include proper relationships and constraints
6. Database migration system (Alembic) configured and initial migration applied
7. Basic CRUD operations work for all entities through FastAPI endpoints

## Story 1.3: Nmap XML Parser
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **automatic parsing of nmap XML scan files into structured data**,
so that **I can immediately see organized host and service information without manual processing**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Parser successfully extracts host information (IP, hostname, OS detection) from nmap XML
2. Parser captures all service details (port, protocol, service, version, banner) accurately
3. Parser handles large scan files (1000+ hosts) without memory errors or crashes
4. Parser detects and reports invalid or corrupted XML files with clear error messages
5. Parsed data is stored in database with proper relationships between hosts and services
6. Parser processes typical nmap scan (100 hosts) in under 5 seconds
7. Parser maintains audit trail of scan file source and processing timestamp

## Story 1.4: Basic Markdown Documentation Generator
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **automatic generation of structured markdown documentation from parsed scan data**,
so that **I have immediately readable technical documentation without manual formatting**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Generator creates GitHub-flavored markdown with proper headers, tables, and code blocks
2. Host sections include collapsible details for services and technical information
3. Service information formatted in readable tables with port, protocol, and version details
4. Code blocks preserve original banner information and technical data formatting
5. Document includes metadata section with scan source, timestamp, and summary statistics
6. Generated markdown validates as proper syntax and renders correctly in standard viewers
7. Large scan outputs (500+ hosts) generate documentation in under 10 seconds
