# Epic 4: CLI Integration & Workflow Automation

**Epic Goal**: Develop comprehensive command-line tools and workflow automation that seamlessly integrates Hermes with existing penetration testing methodologies, enabling cybersecurity professionals to incorporate intelligent documentation into their established workflows without disrupting proven assessment practices.

## Story 4.1: Core CLI Tool Development
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **comprehensive command-line interface for all Hermes functionality**,
so that **I can integrate automated documentation into my existing terminal-based workflow**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. CLI tool supports `hermes import <file>` for immediate scan file processing and documentation generation
2. `hermes pipe` command processes stdin input for integration with tool pipelines (e.g., `nmap -oX - target | hermes pipe`)
3. `hermes export` command generates markdown documentation with configurable output formats and destinations
4. `hermes status` displays current processing status, background research progress, and system health
5. `hermes config` manages API keys, scan directories, and user preferences through command-line interface
6. Comprehensive help system with usage examples and integration patterns for common pentesting workflows
7. Exit codes and error messages follow Unix conventions for reliable scripting and automation integration

## Story 4.2: Directory Monitoring and Automatic Processing
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **automatic monitoring of scan output directories with real-time processing**,
so that **my documentation is continuously updated as I conduct assessments without manual intervention**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. `hermes monitor <directory>` establishes filesystem watching for new scan files with configurable file patterns
2. Automatic file type detection (nmap XML, masscan JSON, dirb text) triggers appropriate parsing workflows
3. Real-time processing notifications show scan ingestion progress and completion status
4. Configurable processing delays prevent incomplete file processing during active scanning
5. Duplicate scan detection prevents reprocessing of identical files with timestamp comparison
6. Background processing maintains system responsiveness during large scan import operations
7. Monitor daemon supports multiple directory watching with independent configuration per directory

## Story 4.3: Integration with Common Pentesting Tools
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **seamless integration with nmap, masscan, dirb, and gobuster workflows**,
so that **I can enhance my existing tool usage without changing my assessment methodology**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Shell integration provides `hermes` wrapper commands for common tools with automatic output capture
2. Nmap integration supports all common output formats with intelligent parsing and cross-referencing
3. Masscan integration handles high-speed scanning outputs with performance optimization for large result sets
4. Directory brute-force tool integration (dirb, gobuster, dirsearch) with web application vulnerability correlation
5. Tool-specific parsing optimizations handle vendor-specific output formats and edge cases reliably
6. Integration templates for common assessment workflows with pre-configured tool chains
7. Plugin architecture allows community-contributed integrations for additional tools and custom workflows

## Story 4.4: Batch Processing and Assessment Workflow Support
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **batch processing capabilities for comprehensive assessment workflows**,
so that **I can process multiple scans and generate complete documentation for complex multi-phase assessments**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Batch import processes multiple scan files with progress tracking and error reporting
2. Assessment project management organizes scans by engagement, target, or methodology phase
3. Incremental processing updates existing documentation as new scan data becomes available
4. Workflow templates for common assessment types (external, internal, web application, wireless)
5. Assessment timeline tracking correlates scan timing with methodology phases and findings
6. Multi-target processing supports parallel assessment documentation with cross-reference capabilities
7. Assessment completion reporting summarizes findings, coverage, and documentation quality metrics

## Story 4.5: Advanced CLI Features and Power User Support
As a **penetration tester**,
I want **advanced CLI features for complex workflows and automation**,
so that **I can customize Hermes integration for my specific assessment requirements and team processes**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. JSON output mode enables CLI integration with custom scripts and workflow automation tools
2. Query interface allows command-line searching and filtering of assessment data with SQL-like syntax
3. Scripting support through configuration files and command chaining for repeatable assessment processes
4. Integration with penetration testing frameworks (Metasploit, Cobalt Strike) through data export and import
5. Team collaboration features support shared assessment data with conflict resolution and synchronization
6. Custom output templates allow organization-specific documentation formats and branding requirements
7. Performance tuning options for resource-constrained environments and large-scale assessments
