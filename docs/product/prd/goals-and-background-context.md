# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Reduce penetration testing documentation time by 40-60% through intelligent automation
- Eliminate duplicate research efforts across team members investigating the same vulnerabilities
- Provide real-time structured documentation from raw scan outputs (nmap, masscan, dirb)
- Create seamless integration with existing pentesting workflows without forcing methodology changes
- Establish community-driven growth through user-contributed templates and marketplace
- Achieve 1,000 active users within 12 months of beta release to validate product-market fit

## Background Context

Penetration testers and cybersecurity professionals face a significant productivity bottleneck where 40-60% of assessment time is consumed by manual documentation and research tasks rather than actual security analysis. Current pentesting platforms excel at vulnerability discovery but treat documentation as an afterthought, leading to duplicate research efforts, inconsistent documentation quality, and knowledge fragmentation across teams.

Hermes addresses this core productivity challenge through an Intelligent Automatic Note-Taking Engine that transforms raw scanning data into structured, researched documentation in real-time. By automating scan parsing, conducting background vulnerability research, and providing collaborative network visualization, Hermes enables cybersecurity professionals to focus on high-value analysis rather than administrative overhead, potentially saving $12,000-$16,800 per week in billable time costs for typical team assessments.
