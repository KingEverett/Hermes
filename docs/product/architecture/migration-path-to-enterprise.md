## Database Migration Path

```sql
-- Future migration to add multi-tenancy
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN organization_id UUID;
ALTER TABLE projects ADD CONSTRAINT fk_organization 
    FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations(id);

-- Add row-level security
ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY project_isolation ON projects
    FOR ALL
    USING (organization_id = current_setting('app.organization_id')::UUID);
```
