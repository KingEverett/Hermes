# Architecture Summary

This MVP architecture delivers on the core promise of Hermes: **eliminating 40-60% of penetration testing documentation time** through intelligent automation. The design focuses on:

✅ **Immediate Value**: Automatic scan parsing and vulnerability research  
✅ **Simple Deployment**: Docker Compose with no cloud dependencies  
✅ **Security First**: Local-only processing, no data transmission  
✅ **Developer Friendly**: Monorepo structure, clear service boundaries  
✅ **Community Focus**: Free, open-source, extensible  
✅ **Growth Ready**: Clear path to enterprise features without rewriting  

The architecture is optimized for the target market of individual pentesters and small teams while maintaining the flexibility to evolve into an enterprise platform through a separate commercial branch when needed.
