# Hermes Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Reduce penetration testing documentation time by 40-60% through intelligent automation
- Eliminate duplicate research efforts across team members investigating the same vulnerabilities
- Provide real-time structured documentation from raw scan outputs (nmap, masscan, dirb)
- Create seamless integration with existing pentesting workflows without forcing methodology changes
- Establish community-driven growth through user-contributed templates and marketplace
- Achieve 1,000 active users within 12 months of beta release to validate product-market fit

### Background Context

Penetration testers and cybersecurity professionals face a significant productivity bottleneck where 40-60% of assessment time is consumed by manual documentation and research tasks rather than actual security analysis. Current pentesting platforms excel at vulnerability discovery but treat documentation as an afterthought, leading to duplicate research efforts, inconsistent documentation quality, and knowledge fragmentation across teams.

Hermes addresses this core productivity challenge through an Intelligent Automatic Note-Taking Engine that transforms raw scanning data into structured, researched documentation in real-time. By automating scan parsing, conducting background vulnerability research, and providing collaborative network visualization, Hermes enables cybersecurity professionals to focus on high-value analysis rather than administrative overhead, potentially saving $12,000-$16,800 per week in billable time costs for typical team assessments.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Hermes prioritizes a clean, professional interface that cybersecurity professionals can trust and deploy in enterprise environments. The design emphasizes information density without clutter, rapid access to detailed technical data, and seamless integration with existing pentesting workflows. The interface should feel familiar to users of professional security tools while providing the intelligent automation that sets Hermes apart.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Command-Line First Design**: UI complements rather than replaces CLI workflows, with full keyboard navigation and Vim-style shortcuts for power users
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex technical data presented through collapsible sections and drill-down interfaces, allowing users to control information depth
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback for scan processing, research status, and system operations to maintain workflow confidence
- **Context-Aware Panels**: Right sidebar dynamically updates with relevant vulnerability details, research results, and actionable information based on current selection

### Core Screens and Views

- **Main Dashboard**: Three-panel layout with network topology visualization as primary workspace, navigation sidebar, and contextual information panel
- **Scan Import Interface**: Drag-and-drop area with CLI command examples and real-time processing status
- **Host Detail View**: Comprehensive technical breakdown of individual hosts with tabbed organization for services, vulnerabilities, and research findings
- **Network Topology View**: Interactive graph visualization with zoom/pan controls, filtering options, and export capabilities
- **Settings and Configuration**: System configuration for API keys, scan directories, and user preferences with security-focused design

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The interface will meet WCAG AA standards to ensure accessibility in enterprise environments and government deployments where compliance is required.

### Branding

Professional cybersecurity aesthetic with dark theme as default (preferred by security professionals for extended use), high contrast ratios for readability, and minimal color palette focused on functional status indicators (red for critical vulnerabilities, yellow for warnings, green for secure services).

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop/laptop screens (1200px+) where penetration testing work occurs, with responsive design that gracefully handles smaller screens by collapsing panels and reorganizing content hierarchy.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing frontend, backend, CLI tools, and documentation with shared types package and comprehensive API documentation via OpenAPI/Swagger. This approach supports the tight integration between components while maintaining development simplicity for MVP phase.

### Service Architecture

**Microservices pattern within monorepo** with separate services for:
- Scan parsing engine (handles nmap XML, masscan JSON, dirb/gobuster text)
- Vulnerability research service (NVD, CISA KEV, ExploitDB API integration)
- Graph generation service (network topology visualization)
- File management service (CLI integration, directory monitoring)
- Web interface service (React frontend with API gateway)

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration testing approach** with:
- Unit tests for scan parsing algorithms and vulnerability research logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- End-to-end tests for CLI workflow and UI interaction paths
- Performance testing for 1000-host scan processing requirements
- Security testing for input validation and API key handling

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Backend Technology**: Python 3.9+ with FastAPI for async API handling, SQLAlchemy for database abstraction, Pydantic for data validation
- **Frontend Technology**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety, D3.js for network visualization, Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Database Strategy**: SQLite for development and single-user deployments, PostgreSQL for team environments requiring concurrent access
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for vulnerability research caching with 24-hour TTL and API rate limit management
- **Background Processing**: Celery with Redis broker for asynchronous vulnerability research tasks
- **Deployment Model**: Docker containerization for consistent deployment, docker-compose for local development, self-hosted deployment model with no cloud dependencies
- **Security Requirements**: All data processing occurs locally, API keys encrypted at rest using OS keyring services, HTTPS required for production
- **Performance Targets**: 15-second processing for 1000-host scans, 2-second visualization updates, 30-second vulnerability research completion
- **CLI Integration**: Support for stdin/stdout pipes, file monitoring, and integration with existing pentesting tool chains
