# Epic 3: Network Visualization & Professional Interface

**Total Story Points:** 26
**Sprint Assignment:** Sprints 5-6
**Status:** Blocked (Waiting for Epic 1 & 2)

## Epic Goal
Create interactive network topology visualization and professional three-panel interface that enables cybersecurity professionals to visually analyze infrastructure relationships, understand attack paths, and navigate complex network data efficiently while maintaining the professional aesthetic required for enterprise deployment.

## Dependencies
**Epic 1 & 2 → Epic 3 Requirements:**
- Parsed scan data from US-1.3
- Enriched vulnerability data from US-2.1
- Severity scores from US-2.1 for color coding
- Research service endpoints from US-2.2

**Epic 3 → Epic 4 Provides:**
- Export capabilities for CLI
- Display logic patterns
- UI components for integration

## Stories

### US-3.1: Basic Network Graph (MVP Version)
**Priority:** P2 (Important)
**Story Points:** 13
**Sprint:** 5
**Dependencies:** US-1.3, US-2.1 (Requires parsed and enriched data)

**User Story:**
As a **penetration tester**, I want **simple network topology visualization** so that **I can understand infrastructure relationships visually**.

**MVP Scope Reduction:**
- Basic force-directed graph only
- Limit to 100 nodes for MVP
- Defer advanced filtering to post-MVP
- Simple color coding by severity only

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Generate nodes for discovered hosts
- [ ] Show service connections to hosts
- [ ] Force-directed layout with minimal overlap
- [ ] Support up to 100 nodes (reduced from 500)
- [ ] Basic color coding for vulnerability severity
- [ ] Render within 2 seconds
- [ ] Export as static image only (PNG)

**Technical Tasks:**
1. Implement D3.js graph generation
2. Create force-directed layout algorithm
3. Add basic node/edge rendering
4. Implement severity color coding
5. Add PNG export functionality
6. Optimize rendering performance

**Definition of Done:**
- Graph displays parsed network data correctly
- Performance requirements met (2 seconds)
- Color coding reflects vulnerability severity
- PNG export works
- Supports 100 nodes without degradation

### US-3.2: Minimal Interactive Controls
**Priority:** P3 (Nice to have)
**Story Points:** 5
**Sprint:** 5
**Dependencies:** US-3.1

**User Story:**
As a **penetration tester**, I want **basic zoom and pan controls** so that **I can navigate the network graph**.

**MVP Scope:**
- Mouse wheel zoom only
- Click-and-drag panning
- Single node selection
- Defer multi-select and keyboard shortcuts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Mouse wheel zoom with smooth scaling
- [ ] Click-and-drag panning
- [ ] Single node selection shows basic info
- [ ] Fit-to-screen button
- [ ] Touch-friendly for tablets

**Technical Tasks:**
1. Implement zoom controls with D3.js
2. Add pan functionality
3. Create node selection handler
4. Build fit-to-screen function
5. Add touch event support
6. Test interaction performance

**Definition of Done:**
- All interaction controls work smoothly
- Node selection shows details panel
- Touch gestures work on tablets
- No performance degradation with interactions

### US-3.3: Simple Three-Panel Layout
**Priority:** P2 (Important)
**Story Points:** 8
**Sprint:** 6
**Dependencies:** US-3.1

**User Story:**
As a **penetration tester**, I want **organized three-panel interface** so that **I can access all information efficiently**.

**MVP Scope:**
- Fixed panel widths for MVP
- Basic dark theme only
- Defer customization features

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Left sidebar (200px) with navigation
- [ ] Center workspace for graph display
- [ ] Right sidebar (300px) for details
- [ ] Responsive collapse at 1200px
- [ ] Professional dark theme
- [ ] Basic state persistence

**Technical Tasks:**
1. Implement React panel layout
2. Add responsive design breakpoints
3. Create dark theme styles
4. Add basic state management
5. Build navigation components
6. Create detail panels

**Definition of Done:**
