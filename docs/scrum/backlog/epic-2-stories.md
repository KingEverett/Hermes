# Epic 2: Vulnerability Research & Data Integration

**Total Story Points:** 36
**Sprint Assignment:** Sprints 3-4
**Status:** Blocked (Waiting for Epic 1)

## Epic Goal
Implement automated background vulnerability research and API integrations that enrich parsed scan data with comprehensive security intelligence, while providing manual editing capabilities and research link options, eliminating the manual research tasks that consume 40-60% of penetration tester time and delivering the core value proposition that differentiates Hermes from existing tools.

## Dependencies
**Epic 1 → Epic 2 Requirements:**
- Parsed scan data from US-1.3
- Data models from US-1.2
- Database schema supports vulnerability data
- API framework setup from US-1.1

**Epic 2 → Epic 3 Provides:**
- Enriched vulnerability data with severity scores
- Research service endpoints
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates

## Stories

### US-2.1: Service Version Analysis
**Priority:** P1 (Critical)
**Story Points:** 13
**Sprint:** 3
**Dependencies:** US-1.3 (Parser output)

**User Story:**
As a **penetration tester**, I want **automatic vulnerability detection from service versions** so that **potential issues are identified without manual analysis**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Extract software versions from service banners
- [ ] Compare against known vulnerable version ranges
- [ ] Detect default credential indicators
- [ ] Provide confidence scoring (high/medium/low)
- [ ] Create manual review queue for uncertain matches
- [ ] Keep false positive rate under 10%
- [ ] Complete analysis within 3 seconds per service

**Technical Tasks:**
1. Build version extraction regex patterns
2. Create vulnerability database schema
3. Implement version comparison logic
4. Add confidence scoring algorithm
5. Build manual review interface
6. Create test suite with known vulnerabilities

**Definition of Done:**
- Version extraction accuracy >90%
- Confidence scoring validated against test data
- False positive rate measured and <10%
- Performance requirements met
- Manual review queue functional

### US-2.2: API Configuration Infrastructure
**Priority:** P1 (Critical)
**Story Points:** 8
**Sprint:** 3
**Dependencies:** US-1.1 (Infrastructure)

**User Story:**
As a **system administrator**, I want **secure API key management** so that **external integrations are reliable and secure**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Secure storage using OS keyring services
- [ ] Configurable rate limiting framework
- [ ] Error handling for API failures and timeouts
- [ ] User interface for enabling/disabling APIs
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms when APIs unavailable
- [ ] API usage monitoring and reporting
- [ ] Background job monitoring with retry logic

**Technical Tasks:**
1. Implement keyring integration
2. Build rate limiting middleware
3. Create API configuration interface
4. Add monitoring and metrics collection
5. Implement retry and fallback logic
6. Create API health check system

**Definition of Done:**
- API keys stored securely
- Rate limiting enforced correctly
- Fallback mechanisms tested
- Configuration UI functional
- Monitoring dashboard shows API status

### US-2.3: NVD Integration (Simplified for MVP)
**Priority:** P2 (Important)
**Story Points:** 15
**Sprint:** 4
**Dependencies:** US-2.2, US-2.1

**User Story:**
As a **penetration tester**, I want **automated CVE research** so that **I have vulnerability details without manual lookups**.

**MVP Scope Reduction:**
- Focus on basic CVE lookup only
- Defer advanced correlation features
- Provide manual research links as primary fallback

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] NVD API v2.0 integration with rate limiting
- [ ] Redis caching with 24-hour TTL
- [ ] Background processing via Celery
- [ ] Include CVE description and CVSS score
- [ ] Generate manual research links when API unavailable
- [ ] Complete research within 60 seconds
- [ ] Clear indication of data source

**Technical Tasks:**
1. Implement NVD API client
2. Set up Redis caching layer
3. Configure Celery workers
4. Build fallback link generation
5. Add result aggregation logic
6. Create integration tests

**Definition of Done:**
- NVD API integration functional
- Caching reduces API calls by 80%
- Background processing handles load
- Fallback links generated correctly
- Research completion time <60 seconds
