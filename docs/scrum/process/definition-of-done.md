# Definition of Done (DoD)

## Story-Level Definition of Done

For a user story to be considered complete, it must meet ALL of the following criteria:

### Functionality Requirements
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] Feature works as specified in user story
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios handled
- [ ] Performance requirements met (if specified)

### Code Quality Standards
- [ ] Code follows project coding standards
- [ ] Code is self-documenting with clear variable/function names
- [ ] No debug code or commented-out code remains
- [ ] Code is properly organized and structured

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>90% coverage for new code)
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing (where applicable)
- [ ] Manual testing completed successfully
- [ ] Performance testing completed (if applicable)
- [ ] No critical or high-priority bugs remain

### Code Review Process
- [ ] Code reviewed by at least one other team member
- [ ] All review comments addressed
- [ ] Code approved by reviewer
- [ ] Knowledge transfer completed (if needed)

### Documentation Standards
- [ ] API documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Technical documentation updated
- [ ] User-facing documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] README updated (if structural changes made)

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Feature integrates properly with existing codebase
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] Database migrations applied successfully (if applicable)
- [ ] Configuration updated (if needed)

### Deployment Readiness
- [ ] Feature deployable to development environment
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations handled
- [ ] Feature flags implemented (if needed)
- [ ] Rollback plan documented (for significant changes)

## Sprint-Level Definition of Done

For a sprint to be considered complete:

### Sprint Goals
- [ ] Sprint goal achieved or explicitly adjusted
- [ ] All committed stories completed
- [ ] Demo prepared and delivered
- [ ] Stakeholder feedback collected

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] All automated tests passing
- [ ] Code coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] No critical bugs in sprint deliverables
- [ ] Performance regressions identified and addressed

### Process Compliance
- [ ] Retrospective conducted
- [ ] Sprint metrics collected and analyzed
- [ ] Impediments documented and addressed
- [ ] Next sprint planning completed

## Epic-Level Definition of Done

For an epic to be considered complete:

### Feature Completeness
- [ ] All epic user stories completed
- [ ] Epic goal achieved and validated
- [ ] Cross-story integration working
- [ ] Epic-level acceptance criteria met

### Validation Gate Requirements
- [ ] All dependency validation gates passed
- [ ] Integration with other epics verified
- [ ] End-to-end workflows tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

### Stakeholder Acceptance
- [ ] Product Owner acceptance obtained
- [ ] Key stakeholders demo completed
- [ ] Feedback incorporated or backlog updated
- [ ] Documentation complete and approved

## Project-Level Definition of Done (MVP)

For the MVP to be considered complete:

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Parse 100-host nmap scan in <15 seconds
- [ ] Generate complete markdown documentation
- [ ] Display network graph with 100 nodes
- [ ] CLI import/export functional
- [ ] Error rate <2%

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] All unit tests passing (>90% coverage)
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (WCAG AA)

### User Experience
- [ ] User onboarding completion >80%
- [ ] All critical user workflows functional
- [ ] Error messages clear and actionable
- [ ] Help documentation complete
- [ ] Professional appearance standards met

### Deployment Readiness
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Monitoring and logging operational
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Documentation complete and published
- [ ] Support processes established

## Quality Gates

### Before Code Review
- Developer must verify all code-level DoD criteria
- All tests must be passing locally
- Self-review completed

### Before Sprint Demo
- All sprint-level DoD criteria met
- Demo script prepared and tested
- Known issues documented

### Before Release
- All project-level DoD criteria met
- Deployment checklist completed
- Stakeholder sign-off obtained

## Non-Negotiable Standards

These items are NEVER optional:

1. **Security**: No security vulnerabilities introduced
2. **Data Integrity**: No data corruption or loss possible
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation implemented
5. **Testing**: Critical paths covered by automated tests

## Continuous Improvement

This Definition of Done should be:
- Reviewed after each sprint retrospective
- Updated based on lessons learned
- Aligned with evolving quality standards
- Validated with stakeholders regularly

**Note**: If any DoD criteria cannot be met, the story/sprint/epic is NOT considered done and should be moved back to the appropriate backlog with clear identification of what remains to be completed.
