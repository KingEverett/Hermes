## Story 3.11: Architecture Documentation Completion üìù

**Status:** NEEDS CREATION

**Summary:** Create missing architecture documentation files identified by QA

### User Story

**As a** developer joining the Hermes project,
**I want** comprehensive coding standards and testing strategy documentation,
**So that** I can write consistent, high-quality code that follows team conventions.

### Story Context

**Background:**
QA review of Story 3.9 identified missing architecture documentation (QA gate issue ARCH-001). The following files are referenced throughout stories but don't exist:
- `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`
- `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`

These gaps cause:
- Inconsistent code patterns across stories
- Unclear testing expectations for developers
- Difficulty onboarding new team members
- QA having to validate against implicit standards

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: All development stories, QA review process
- Technology: Markdown documentation
- Follows pattern: Existing architecture docs structure
- Touch points: devLoadAlwaysFiles in core-config.yaml

### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` exists with comprehensive guidelines
2. `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md` exists with testing approach documentation
3. Both documents follow existing architecture documentation format/structure

**Content Requirements - Coding Standards:**
4. TypeScript/JavaScript conventions (naming, formatting, types)
5. React patterns and best practices (hooks, components, state management)
6. File organization and structure guidelines
7. Import/export conventions
8. Error handling patterns
9. API integration patterns (React Query usage)
10. Code review checklist

**Content Requirements - Testing Strategy:**
11. Testing philosophy and pyramid approach
12. Unit test patterns and examples
13. Integration test patterns (MSW usage documented)
14. Test file organization and naming
15. Mock/stub strategies
16. Code coverage expectations
17. CI/CD integration requirements

**Integration Requirements:**
18. Documents are added to devLoadAlwaysFiles in core-config.yaml
19. References to these docs throughout existing stories remain valid
20. QA can use these docs as review criteria

### Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Review existing code patterns in Epic 3 stories to document actual practices
- Extract patterns from Story 3.1-3.9 implementations
- Document MSW testing approach from Story 3.9/3.10
- Align with React Query, Zustand, and D3 best practices

**Content Sources:**
- Story 3.1-3.9 implementation patterns
- QA feedback from gate reviews
- React/TypeScript industry best practices
- MSW testing patterns from Story 3.10

**Key Constraints:**
- Must reflect actual project practices (not aspirational)
- Should be actionable and specific, not generic
- Examples should reference actual project code
- Should evolve as project patterns mature

### Definition of Done

- [ ] coding-standards.md created with all required sections
- [ ] testing-strategy.md created with all required sections
- [ ] Both docs added to core-config.yaml devLoadAlwaysFiles
- [ ] Documents reviewed by dev and QA for accuracy
- [ ] At least 2 code examples per major section
- [ ] Documents are discoverable (linked from main architecture doc)

### Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Documentation becomes outdated as patterns evolve
**Mitigation:** Include "last reviewed" dates, make docs living documents
**Rollback:** N/A (documentation only)

### Estimated Effort

**Time:** 4-6 hours total
- Research existing patterns: 1-2 hours
- Write coding-standards.md: 2-3 hours
- Write testing-strategy.md: 1-2 hours
- Review and refinement: 30 mins

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks consistent development practices and QA effectiveness

## Story 3.12: E2E Test Suite with Cypress/Playwright üìù

**Status:** NEEDS CREATION

**Summary:** Add end-to-end test coverage to supplement integration tests

### User Story

**As a** QA engineer,
**I want** automated end-to-end tests for critical user workflows,
**So that** I can verify the full application stack works correctly before releases.

### Story Context

**Background:**
QA recommended E2E testing during Story 3.9 review (gate issue TEST-001). Current test coverage:
- ‚úÖ Unit tests: Component-level (Story 3.6, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Integration tests: MSW-based API mocking (Story 3.9, 3.10)
- ‚ùå E2E tests: Missing - no browser automation

E2E gaps:
- Real API interactions not tested
- Browser-specific behavior not validated
- Multi-step user workflows not covered
- Visual regression not detected

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Full application stack (frontend + backend)
- Technology: Cypress or Playwright (choose one)
- Follows pattern: Industry standard E2E testing
- Touch points: Frontend app, backend API, test CI/CD pipeline

### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. E2E test framework selected (Cypress or Playwright) and installed
2. Test infrastructure configured (package.json scripts, CI integration)
3. At least 3 critical user workflows have E2E test coverage

**Critical Workflows to Test:**
4. **Workflow 1: Application Load & Project Display**
   - App loads successfully
   - Default project fetched from API
   - Network graph renders with real topology data

5. **Workflow 2: Node Selection & Details**
   - User clicks a node in network graph
   - Node details panel displays correct information
   - State persists across interactions

6. **Workflow 3: Error Handling & Retry**
   - Backend unavailable scenario
   - Error UI displays correctly
   - Retry button successfully reconnects

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Tests run reliably in CI/CD pipeline
8. Tests can run against local backend (http://localhost:8000)
9. Tests have appropriate timeouts and retry logic
10. Test reports are generated and accessible

**Documentation Requirements:**
11. E2E test setup documented in testing-strategy.md
12. README includes instructions to run E2E tests
13. CI/CD integration documented

### Technical Notes

**Framework Decision Criteria:**

**Cypress:**
- ‚úÖ Easier to learn, great DX
- ‚úÖ Time-travel debugging
- ‚úÖ Auto-waiting and retry logic
- ‚ùå Chrome/Firefox only (no Safari)
- ‚ùå iframe limitations

**Playwright:**
- ‚úÖ Multi-browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ‚úÖ Better for complex interactions
- ‚úÖ Parallel execution built-in
- ‚ùå Steeper learning curve
- ‚ùå Less mature ecosystem

**Recommendation:** Start with Cypress for MVP simplicity, evaluate Playwright later if multi-browser needed.

**Integration Approach:**
- Backend must be running for E2E tests (not mocked)
- Test fixtures for seeding test data in backend
- Separate E2E test scripts from unit/integration tests
- CI pipeline runs E2E tests after integration tests pass

**Key Constraints:**
- Backend API must be stable and reliable
- Test data setup/teardown strategy needed
- Tests should be independent (can run in any order)
- Reasonable execution time (< 5 minutes for critical workflows)

### Definition of Done

- [ ] E2E framework installed and configured
- [ ] 3 critical workflows have passing E2E tests
- [ ] Tests run locally via npm script
- [ ] Tests integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated (testing-strategy.md, README)
- [ ] Test failure reports are actionable

### Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** E2E tests are flaky or slow, blocking CI/CD
**Mitigation:** Focus on 3 critical workflows only, ensure proper waits/timeouts
**Rollback:** Remove E2E tests from CI, run manually only

**Secondary Risk:** Backend test data management becomes complex
**Mitigation:** Use simple test fixtures, reset between runs

### Estimated Effort

**Time:** 6-8 hours total
- Framework selection and setup: 1-2 hours
- Workflow 1 tests: 2 hours
- Workflow 2 tests: 1.5 hours
- Workflow 3 tests: 1.5 hours
- CI integration: 1 hour
- Documentation: 1 hour

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Quality improvement, not MVP-blocking

## Prioritization Recommendation

### Sprint Planning Order:

**1. Story 3.11 - Architecture Documentation** (HIGH - Do Next)
- **Why:** Blocks team consistency, QA effectiveness
- **Value:** Immediate benefit for all future stories
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Effort:** 4-6 hours

**2. Story 3.10 - React Query Cache Isolation** (MEDIUM)
- **Why:** Improves test reliability and CI/CD confidence
- **Value:** Quality gates more reliable
- **Dependencies:** None (already created)
- **Effort:** 2-3 hours

**3. Story 3.12 - E2E Test Suite** (MEDIUM - Future Sprint)
- **Why:** Adds safety net but not urgent for MVP
- **Value:** Confidence in releases, catches integration bugs
- **Dependencies:** Story 3.11 (testing-strategy.md should include E2E approach)
- **Effort:** 6-8 hours

### Total Technical Debt: 12-17 hours

This is reasonable technical debt from an MVP delivery that prioritized functional value. All three stories improve quality without blocking user-facing features.

- Test wrapper should be reusable for future tests

**Story 3.12 Tips:**
- Start simple - 3 workflows only
- Backend must be running (not mocked)
- Ensure tests are independent and deterministic

---

## Questions for Team Discussion

1. **Story 3.11:** Should we include API design patterns in coding standards?
2. **Story 3.10:** Should test wrapper support custom QueryClient config per test?
3. **Story 3.12:** Cypress or Playwright? (Recommend Cypress for MVP)
4. **Priority:** Should we tackle 3.11 before 3.10? (Yes - higher impact)

---

## Conclusion

These three follow-up stories represent strategic investments in quality and maintainability. They address technical debt identified during Story 3.9 delivery but don't block MVP functionality. Recommend completing them over the next 1-2 sprints in the priority order listed above.

**Next Action:** Create Story 3.11 (Architecture Documentation) for sprint planning.
