# Story 3.10: Test Infrastructure - React Query Cache Isolation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** React Query cache to be properly isolated between tests,
**So that** all App integration tests pass reliably without cross-test pollution.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: App.test.tsx test suite (Story 3.9)
- Technology: React Testing Library, Jest, MSW, React Query
- Follows pattern: Test isolation patterns from Story 3.6
- Touch points: App.tsx (QueryClient), setupTests.ts, test helper utilities

**Background:**
Story 3.9 delivered MSW infrastructure and improved test reliability from 2/9 to 3/9 passing tests. The remaining 6 test failures are caused by React Query's QueryClient cache persisting between tests, causing subsequent tests to see cached data from previous tests instead of fresh MSW responses.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. All 9 tests in App.test.tsx pass consistently
2. Each test runs with isolated React Query cache (no cross-test pollution)
3. MSW handlers properly integrate with isolated QueryClient instances

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing MSW server setup in setupTests.ts continues to work unchanged
5. Test isolation follows React Query testing best practices (@tanstack/react-query patterns)
6. Integration with App.tsx QueryClient maintains current behavior in production

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Tests are deterministic and don't have race conditions
8. Test execution time doesn't significantly increase (< 20% overhead)
9. No regression in the 3 currently passing tests

  - [x] Update test file with usage example in header comment
  - [x] Create brief testing guide if needed (optional)
  - [x] Share pattern with team for future test files

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Create a test wrapper utility that provides fresh QueryClient per test
- Use React Testing Library's custom render function pattern
- Maintain existing MSW infrastructure without changes

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- Story 3.6 has successful React Query test patterns to reference
- React Query docs: https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/testing
- Pattern: `renderWithClient` wrapper that creates isolated QueryClient

**Key Constraints:**
- Must not modify production App.tsx QueryClient configuration
- MSW server setup must remain in setupTests.ts (global)
- QueryClient isolation is test-specific only
- Solution must be reusable for future test files

**Known Issues Being Fixed:**
1. **Test: "shows error UI when API fails"** - sees cached success from previous test
2. **Test: "shows error UI when fetch returns non-ok response"** - same cache issue
3. **Test: "shows empty state when no projects exist"** - sees cached projects
4. **Test: "retry button refetches data on error"** - cache prevents refetch
5. **Test: "applies dark theme styling"** - may see cached data instead of loading
6. **Test: "renders first project as default"** - sees wrong cached project

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met (all 9 tests passing)
- [x] Integration requirements verified (MSW + isolated cache works)
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested (3 passing tests still pass)
- [x] Code follows React Query testing best practices
- [x] Tests pass consistently (run 3+ times successfully)
- [x] Documentation added (comments in wrapper utility)

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Test isolation approach might have edge cases with async behavior
- **Mitigation:** Follow official React Query testing patterns, test thoroughly
- **Rollback:** Revert to current App.test.tsx, only test files affected

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs (test-only changes)
- [x] No production code changes required
- [x] No UI changes (test infrastructure only)
- [x] Performance impact is negligible (test execution only)

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**
- [x] Story can be completed in one development session (2-3 hours)
- [x] Integration approach is straightforward (wrapper pattern)
- [x] Follows existing patterns (React Query testing docs)
- [x] No design or architecture work required

**Clarity Check:**
- [x] Story requirements are unambiguous (fix 6 failing tests)
- [x] Integration points are clearly specified (test files only)
- [x] Success criteria are testable (all tests pass)
- [x] Rollback approach is simple (revert test files)

## Dev Notes

### Reference Materials
- **Story 3.9**: Current test implementation with MSW
- **Story 3.6**: Successful React Query test patterns
- **React Query Testing Guide**: https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/testing

### Expected Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// src/test-utils/query-test-wrapper.tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';

export function createTestQueryClient() {
  return new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
      queries: { retry: false, gcTime: 0, staleTime: 0 },
    },
  });
}

export function renderWithQueryClient(ui: React.ReactElement) {
  const testQueryClient = createTestQueryClient();
  return render(
    <QueryClientProvider client={testQueryClient}>
      {ui}
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

### Testing Strategy
1. Each test gets its own QueryClient via wrapper
2. MSW handlers still work (they mock fetch, not React Query)
3. No cache pollution between tests
4. Deterministic, reliable test execution

### Debug Log References
None

### Completion Notes

**All Tasks Completed Successfully**

1. **Blocker Resolution**: MSW infrastructure was already in place (msw-server.ts existed)
2. **Test Isolation Approach**: Chose wrapper component pattern over beforeEach reset
   - Rationale: Aligns with React Query official docs, prevents singleton QueryClient issues
   - Implementation: renderWithQueryClient creates fresh QueryClient per test

3. **Key Implementation Detail**:
   - App.tsx creates singleton QueryClient - can't be isolated in tests
   - Solution: Exported AppContent separately and wrapped it in tests with isolated QueryClient
   - Pattern: `renderApp() => renderWithQueryClient(<ErrorBoundary><AppContent /></ErrorBoundary>)`

4. **Test Results**:
   - ✅ All 9 tests passing (was 3/9 before fix)
   - ✅ Run 3 times successfully (1.106s, 0.831s, 1.016s avg)
   - ✅ < 20% overhead requirement met (tests actually faster: ~1s vs previous 16s)
   - ✅ No regression in previously passing tests

5. **Documentation Added**:
   - Comprehensive JSDoc in query-test-wrapper.tsx
   - Usage examples in App.test.tsx header
   - Explanation of why AppContent vs App pattern was needed

### File List

**Created:**
- frontend/web-app/src/test-utils/query-test-wrapper.tsx

**Modified:**
- frontend/web-app/src/App.tsx (exported AppContent for testing)
- frontend/web-app/src/__tests__/App.test.tsx (migrated to isolated QueryClient pattern)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-02

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: Excellent**

This story delivers a textbook implementation of React Query test isolation. The solution follows official React Query testing best practices and solves the cache pollution problem elegantly through a reusable wrapper pattern. All 9 tests now pass reliably, improving from 3/9 before this fix.

**Key Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns (AppContent exported for testability)
- Well-documented code with comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Follows React Query official testing patterns exactly
- Reusable utility that can be applied to future test files
- Performance improvement (tests run faster: ~1s vs previous 16s)

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was required. The implementation is already at production quality.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent - follows React/TypeScript best practices
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Test utilities properly organized in `src/test-utils/`
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Exceeds expectations - follows React Query official testing guide
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 9 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1: All 9 tests in App.test.tsx pass consistently**
- ✓ Given the test suite is executed
- ✓ When all tests run
- ✓ Then all 9 tests pass (verified with multiple runs: 1.106s, 0.831s, 1.016s)

**AC2: Each test runs with isolated React Query cache**
- ✓ Given renderWithQueryClient is used
- ✓ When each test renders components
- ✓ Then a fresh QueryClient is created per test (via createTestQueryClient)

**AC3: MSW handlers properly integrate with isolated QueryClient**
- ✓ Given MSW server is configured in setupTests.ts
- ✓ When tests use server.use() to override handlers
- ✓ Then MSW mocks work correctly with isolated QueryClient instances

**AC4: Existing MSW server setup continues to work unchanged**
- ✓ Given setupTests.ts MSW configuration
- ✓ When tests run
- ✓ Then MSW lifecycle (beforeAll/afterEach/afterAll) functions correctly

**AC5: Test isolation follows React Query testing best practices**
- ✓ Given the React Query testing guide patterns
- ✓ When query-test-wrapper.tsx is implemented
- ✓ Then the wrapper creates fresh QueryClient with test-appropriate settings (retry: false, gcTime: 0, staleTime: 0)

**AC6: Integration with App.tsx QueryClient maintains production behavior**
- ✓ Given App.tsx creates singleton QueryClient
- ✓ When AppContent is exported separately
- ✓ Then production app uses singleton, tests use isolated instances

**AC7: Tests are deterministic without race conditions**
- ✓ Given proper cache isolation
- ✓ When tests run multiple times
- ✓ Then results are consistent (verified 3+ runs)

**AC8: Test execution time < 20% overhead**
- ✓ Given the performance requirement
- ✓ When test suite executes
- ✓ Then performance actually improved (1s vs 16s previously = ~94% faster)

**AC9: No regression in 3 currently passing tests**
- ✓ Given the 3 previously passing tests
- ✓ When migration to isolated QueryClient occurs
- ✓ Then all 3 tests still pass plus 6 additional tests now pass

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Coverage: Excellent**
- 9 comprehensive integration tests covering all user-facing states
- Loading, success, error, empty, retry scenarios all validated
- Edge cases handled (multiple projects, theme styling)

**Test Design Quality: Excellent**
- Tests are well-organized with clear arrange-act-assert structure
- Helper function (renderApp) reduces duplication
- MSW handler overrides are test-specific and isolated
- Timeouts are appropriate (3s for async operations)

**Test Isolation: Excellent**
- Each test receives fresh QueryClient instance
- MSW server resets handlers between tests
- No shared state between tests
- Pattern is reusable for other components

**Test Maintainability: Excellent**
- Comprehensive documentation in file headers
- JSDoc comments explain the why, not just the what
- Clear examples of usage pattern
- Future developers will understand the approach

### Security Review

**Status: PASS**

No security concerns. This story only modifies test infrastructure with no production code changes beyond exporting AppContent for testing purposes.

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS - Exceeds Expectations**

Test execution time dramatically improved:
- Previous: ~16s for unreliable tests
- Current: ~1s for all 9 passing tests
- Improvement: 94% faster execution
- Well under the 20% overhead requirement (AC8)

The isolated QueryClient configuration (retry: false, gcTime: 0, staleTime: 0) ensures fast, predictable test execution.

### Files Modified During Review

None. No changes required during QA review.
