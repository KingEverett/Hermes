# Story 3.11: Architecture Documentation Completion

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer joining the Hermes project,
**I want** comprehensive coding standards and testing strategy documentation,
**so that** I can write consistent, high-quality code that follows team conventions.

## Story Context

**Background:**
QA review of Story 3.9 identified missing architecture documentation (QA gate issue ARCH-001). The following files are referenced in `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` devLoadAlwaysFiles but don't exist:
- `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`
- `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`

These gaps cause:
- Inconsistent code patterns across stories
- Unclear testing expectations for developers
- Difficulty onboarding new team members
- QA having to validate against implicit standards

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: All development stories, QA review process
- Technology: Markdown documentation
- Follows pattern: Existing architecture docs structure in `docs/product/architecture/`
- Touch points: devLoadAlwaysFiles in `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` exists with comprehensive guidelines
2. `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md` exists with testing approach documentation
3. Both documents follow existing architecture documentation format/structure

**Content Requirements - Coding Standards:**
4. TypeScript/JavaScript conventions (naming, formatting, types)
5. React patterns and best practices (hooks, components, state management)
6. File organization and structure guidelines
7. Import/export conventions
8. Error handling patterns
9. API integration patterns (React Query usage)
10. Code review checklist

**Content Requirements - Testing Strategy:**
11. Testing philosophy and pyramid approach
12. Unit test patterns and examples
13. Integration test patterns (MSW usage documented)
14. Test file organization and naming
15. Mock/stub strategies
16. Code coverage expectations
17. CI/CD integration requirements

**Integration Requirements:**
18. Documents are added to devLoadAlwaysFiles in `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
19. References to these docs throughout existing stories remain valid
20. QA can use these docs as review criteria

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Review existing code patterns in Epic 3 stories to document actual practices (not aspirational)
- Extract patterns from Story 3.1-3.9 implementations as concrete examples
- Document MSW testing approach from Story 3.9/3.10 test infrastructure
- Align with React Query, Zustand, and D3 best practices already in use

**Content Sources (Extract Real Examples From):**
- **App.tsx**: React Query setup, QueryClient configuration, error handling patterns
- **ErrorBoundary.tsx**: Error boundary pattern, class component example
- **App.test.tsx**: Integration testing patterns, MSW usage, test structure
- **query-test-wrapper.tsx**: Test isolation patterns, QueryClient test configuration
- **msw-server.ts**: MSW setup, handler configuration
- **setupTests.ts**: Test environment setup, global test configuration
- **stores/\***: Zustand state management patterns
- **hooks/\***: Custom React hooks patterns
- **components/\*\*/*.tsx**: Component organization, naming conventions

**Key Constraints:**
- Documents must reflect actual project practices (not generic best practices)
- Should be actionable and specific with code examples from the project
- Examples should reference actual project files and line numbers where helpful
- Should evolve as project patterns mature (living documents)
- Documents are for developer consumption, not external stakeholders

**Architecture Location Discovery:**
Current investigation shows architecture docs may be in `docs/product/architecture/` rather than `docs/architecture/`. Task 4 will verify the correct location and ensure consistency.

## Definition of Done

- [x] coding-standards.md created with all required sections (AC: 4-10)
- [x] testing-strategy.md created with all required sections (AC: 11-17)
- [x] Both docs added to `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` devLoadAlwaysFiles (AC: 18)
- [x] Documents follow existing architecture doc format (AC: 3)
- [x] At least 2 code examples per major section from actual project code
- [x] Documents reference actual project files (e.g., "See App.tsx:9-18")
- [x] All sections referenced in Story 3.1-3.10 exist in new docs (AC: 19)
- [x] QA can use these docs as review criteria (AC: 20)

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Documentation becomes outdated as patterns evolve
**Mitigation:** Include "Last Updated" dates in document headers, treat as living documents

**Secondary Risk:** Documents may not cover all implicit standards
**Mitigation:** Start with core patterns, iterate based on team feedback

**Rollback:** N/A (documentation only, no code changes)

## Estimated Effort

**Time:** 4-6 hours total
- Research existing patterns: 1-2 hours
- Write coding-standards.md: 2-3 hours
- Write testing-strategy.md: 1-2 hours
- Update config and cross-reference: 30 mins

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks consistent development practices and QA effectiveness

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- **Story 3.9**: Completed application integration with React Query, ErrorBoundary, MSW testing
- **Story 3.10**: Implemented React Query test isolation pattern with query-test-wrapper.tsx
- **QA Feedback**: Gate issue ARCH-001 identified missing coding-standards.md and testing-strategy.md
- **Core Config**: devLoadAlwaysFiles references these docs but they don't exist yet

### Project Structure Context

**Current Architecture Documentation Location:**
Based on research, architecture docs exist in `docs/product/architecture/` NOT `docs/architecture/`:
- `docs/product/architecture/technology-stack.md` - exists
- `docs/product/architecture/testing-strategy.md` - exists (basic examples only)
- `docs/product/architecture/frontend-architecture.md` - exists

**Target File Locations (To Be Verified in Task 4):**
```
docs/
├── architecture/                 # May need to create this directory
│   ├── coding-standards.md      # Create here (NEW)
│   └── testing-strategy.md      # Create here (NEW, enhanced version)
└── product/
    └── architecture/             # Existing location
        ├── technology-stack.md   # Reference this
        ├── testing-strategy.md   # Basic examples exist here
        └── frontend-architecture.md  # Reference this
```

**Note:** Task 4 will determine if we create `docs/architecture/` or add to `docs/product/architecture/`. The `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` currently references `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` and `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`, suggesting we should create the `docs/architecture/` directory.

[Source: .bmad-core/core-config.yaml lines 17-18, docs/product/architecture/ directory]

### TypeScript/React Patterns to Document

**React Component Patterns (Extract from actual code):**
- Functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Props interface naming: `{ComponentName}Props`
- React.FC vs function declaration (both used in project)
- Hook usage rules (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
- Error boundary class component pattern

[Source: App.tsx, ErrorBoundary.tsx, components/**/*.tsx]

**State Management Patterns:**
- React Query for server state (queries, mutations, cache config)
- QueryClient configuration (staleTime: 5min, gcTime: 10min, retry: 2)
- Zustand for UI state (stores/\*.ts patterns)
- Local useState for component-specific state

[Source: App.tsx lines 9-18, stores/\*.ts]

**Import/Export Conventions:**
- Named exports for components (export function ComponentName)
- Default export for main App component
- Relative imports for local components
- Absolute imports not used (could document as future improvement)

[Source: App.tsx lines 1-5, 86-88]

**Error Handling Patterns:**
- ErrorBoundary for React errors (class component with getDerivedStateFromError)
- Try/catch in async functions
- React Query error states (error, isError)
- Conditional error UI rendering with retry buttons

[Source: ErrorBoundary.tsx, App.tsx lines 36-55]

### Testing Patterns to Document

**Test File Organization:**
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ComponentName.tsx
│   └── __tests__/
│       └── ComponentName.test.tsx
└── __tests__/
    └── App.test.tsx
```

[Source: frontend/web-app/src/ directory structure]

**React Query Test Isolation Pattern:**
```typescript
// From query-test-wrapper.tsx
export function createTestQueryClient() {
  return new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
      queries: { retry: false, gcTime: 0, staleTime: 0 },
    },
  });
}
```

[Source: test-utils/query-test-wrapper.tsx]

**MSW Integration Test Pattern:**
```typescript
// From App.test.tsx
server.use(
  rest.get('/api/v1/projects/', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json(mockProjects));
  })
);
```

[Source: __tests__/App.test.tsx lines 76-80]

**Testing Best Practices Found:**
- Isolated QueryClient per test (no cache pollution)
- MSW for API mocking (global server setup in setupTests.ts)
- waitFor with 3s timeout for async assertions
- jest.mock for complex component dependencies
- userEvent for user interaction testing

[Source: App.test.tsx, query-test-wrapper.tsx, setupTests.ts]

### Testing

**Testing Standards for Documentation Story:**
This story creates documentation only, no code changes (except core-config.yaml update).

**Validation Testing:**
1. Verify `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` devLoadAlwaysFiles correctly references new docs
2. Verify all file paths in documentation are valid (no broken references)
3. Verify code examples compile/run (spot check key examples)
4. Verify documents are readable in markdown preview
5. Verify QA can find relevant sections for gate review criteria

**No unit tests required** - documentation verification only
