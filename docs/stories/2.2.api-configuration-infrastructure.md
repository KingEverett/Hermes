import keyring
import redis
from typing import Dict, Optional, List
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum

class ApiProvider(Enum):
    NVD = "nvd"
    CISA_KEV = "cisa_kev"
    EXPLOITDB = "exploitdb"

@dataclass
class ApiConfiguration:
    provider: ApiProvider
    enabled: boolean
    api_key: Optional[str]
    rate_limit_calls: int
    rate_limit_period: int  # seconds
    timeout: int  # seconds
    retry_attempts: int
    circuit_breaker_threshold: int

class ApiKeyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.service_name = "hermes"

    def store_api_key(self, provider: ApiProvider, api_key: str) -> bool:
        """Store API key securely using OS keyring services"""
        try:
            keyring.set_password(self.service_name, provider.value, api_key)
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to store API key for {provider}: {e}")
            return False

    def get_api_key(self, provider: ApiProvider) -> Optional[str]:
        """Retrieve API key from keyring with fallback to environment"""
        try:
            key = keyring.get_password(self.service_name, provider.value)
            if not key:
                # Fallback to environment variable for development
                key = os.getenv(f"{provider.value.upper()}_API_KEY")
            return key
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to retrieve API key for {provider}: {e}")
            return None

class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, redis_client: redis.Redis):
        self.redis = redis_client

    async def acquire(self, provider: ApiProvider, config: ApiConfiguration) -> bool:
        """Implement token bucket rate limiting with Redis"""
        key = f"ratelimit:{provider.value}:{datetime.now().minute}"
        current = self.redis.incr(key)

        if current == 1:
            self.redis.expire(key, config.rate_limit_period)

        if current > config.rate_limit_calls:
            return False
        return True
```

**Required Dependencies and Integrations:**
- python-keyring for secure OS keyring integration
- Redis for rate limiting and caching
- CircuitBreaker pattern for API failure handling
- Integration with existing Celery background processing

    id: str
    provider: ApiProvider  # 'nvd' | 'cisa_kev' | 'exploitdb'
    enabled: bool
    rate_limit_calls: int
    rate_limit_period: int  # seconds
    timeout: int  # seconds
    retry_attempts: int

    last_check: Date
    consecutive_failures: int
    error_message: Optional[str]
    response_time: Optional[float]
```

**Integration with Existing Models:**
- ResearchTask model already supports different sources (nvd, exploitdb, cisa)

### Rate Limiting Implementation Details
[Source: Architecture analysis and NFR7]

**Provider-Specific Rate Limits:**
```python
RATE_LIMITS = {
    ApiProvider.NVD: {
        'calls': 1,
        'period': 6,  # 6-second delay as per NFR7
        'burst_limit': 5
    },
    ApiProvider.CISA_KEV: {
        'calls': 10,
        'period': 60,  # 10 calls per minute
        'burst_limit': 20
    },
    ApiProvider.EXPLOITDB: {
        'calls': 30,
        'period': 60,  # 30 calls per minute
        'burst_limit': 50
    }
}
```

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
- Open circuit after 5 consecutive failures
- Half-open state after 30 seconds
- Close circuit after 3 successful calls
- Automatic fallback to manual research links

### Security Requirements
[Source: NFR6 and architecture security requirements]

**Keyring Integration:**
- Use OS keyring services (Windows Credential Store, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service)
- Encryption at rest for stored API keys
- Environment variable fallback for development/CI environments
- No API keys stored in plain text or configuration files

**Access Control:**
- API key access requires proper authentication
- Configuration changes require admin privileges
- Audit logging for all API key operations
- Secure key rotation mechanisms

### Performance Requirements
[Source: NFR3 and architecture constraints]

**Specific Performance Targets:**
- API calls complete within 30 seconds (NFR3)
- Rate limiting with sub-second response time
- Background job monitoring with real-time updates
- Health checks complete within 5 seconds
- Configuration changes apply immediately

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use Redis for high-performance rate limiting
- Async HTTP clients for non-blocking API calls
- Background health checking to minimize latency
- Caching of configuration data in memory
- Efficient database queries for usage metrics

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/product/architecture.md#testing-strategy and previous story patterns]

**Backend Testing Standards:**
- **Test Location**: `backend/tests/` directory
- **Framework**: pytest for all backend tests
- **API Configuration Testing**: Test keyring integration and rate limiting
- **Error Handling Testing**: Validate timeout and failure scenarios
- **Integration Testing**: Test complete configuration workflow

**Required Test Scenarios:**
- Keyring storage and retrieval with different OS backends
- Rate limiting accuracy under concurrent load
- API failure handling and circuit breaker behavior
- Configuration persistence and validation
- Background job retry logic and monitoring
- Health check accuracy and performance
- Security validation for API key handling

### Project Structure Notes
Current backend structure aligns well with requirements:
- ✅ `backend/services/` exists for API configuration services
- ✅ `backend/api/` exists for configuration endpoints
- ✅ `backend/models/` exists for new configuration models
- ✅ `backend/repositories/` exists for data access patterns
- ✅ `backend/workers/` exists for monitoring task processing
- ✅ `backend/tests/` exists for comprehensive testing
- ✅ Redis infrastructure operational for rate limiting
- ✅ FastAPI application structure ready for new endpoints

**New Directory Structure Needed:**
- `backend/services/config/` - New subdirectory for configuration services
- All paths follow established project organization patterns from previous stories.

### Technical Constraints
[Source: Architecture documents and technology stack]
- **Security**: OS keyring integration required, no plaintext storage
- **Performance**: Rate limiting must not add significant latency
- **Reliability**: Circuit breaker must prevent cascade failures
- **Database Compatibility**: Code must work with both SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Background Processing**: Use existing Celery infrastructure

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates strong architectural design with well-separated concerns across services, comprehensive error handling patterns, and thoughtful security considerations for API key management. The code follows functional programming principles with clear function signatures and appropriate use of async/await patterns.

**However, there are CRITICAL integration issues that would prevent the system from functioning:**

1. **API Routes Not Registered** - The new `/api/v1/config` and `/api/v1/monitoring` endpoints are implemented but never registered with the FastAPI application in `main.py`
2. **Model Base Mismatch** - The new models define their own `Base = declarative_base()` instead of importing from `models.base`, causing database schema fragmentation
3. **Missing Model Exports** - New models are not exported in `models/__init__.py`, preventing imports from working correctly
4. **Missing Import** - `api_configuration.py` line 304 uses `timedelta` but doesn't import it from datetime

These issues indicate the implementation was not tested end-to-end before marking as Ready to Review.

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `backend/main.py`
- **Change**: Added imports and router registration for configuration and monitoring endpoints
- **Why**: The new API endpoints were completely inaccessible without registration
- **How**: Added proper FastAPI router includes following existing pattern

```python
from api.configuration import router as configuration_router
from api.monitoring import router as monitoring_router
app.include_router(configuration_router)
app.include_router(monitoring_router)
```

**File**: `backend/models/api_configuration.py`
- **Change**: Replaced local `Base = declarative_base()` with import from `models.base`
- **Why**: Database models must share a single Base for proper Alembic migrations and schema management
- **How**: Imported Base from models.base and removed duplicate declaration

**File**: `backend/models/__init__.py`
- **Change**: Added exports for new models and enums
- **Why**: Enables proper imports throughout the application
- **How**: Added comprehensive exports following established patterns

**File**: `backend/services/config/api_configuration.py`  
- **Change**: Added missing `timedelta` import from datetime module
- **Why**: Code referenced `timedelta` on line 304 without importing it
- **How**: Updated datetime import to include timedelta

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (Good functional programming, clear naming, proper async patterns)
- Project Structure: ✗ (Integration issues, files not wired together properly)
- Testing Strategy: ⚠️ (Unit tests present but no integration tests to catch wiring issues)
- All ACs Met: ⚠️ (AC 1-6 implemented, AC 7 incomplete as documented)

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Registered API routers in main.py (backend/main.py)
- [x] Fixed Base import in models (backend/models/api_configuration.py)
- [x] Added model exports (backend/models/__init__.py)
- [x] Fixed missing timedelta import (backend/services/config/api_configuration.py)
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete API configuration workflow
- [ ] Complete Task 7: Background job monitoring with Celery integration
- [ ] Add end-to-end test that validates all endpoints are accessible
- [ ] Consider adding API key rotation functionality for production security
- [ ] Add rate limiter performance tests under concurrent load

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- ✓ Excellent use of OS keyring services for secure API key storage
- ✓ Additional encryption layer using Fernet for defense in depth
- ✓ Environment variable fallback for development without compromising production security
- ✓ API key validation patterns prevent invalid formats
- ✓ No plaintext API keys in configuration or logs

**Concerns:**
- ⚠️ Encryption key itself stored in keyring - consider hardware security module (HSM) for production
- ⚠️ No API key rotation mechanism implemented
- ⚠️ No audit logging for API key access (who accessed which keys when)
- ⚠️ Circuit breaker state not persisted across restarts

### Performance Considerations

**Strengths:**
- ✓ Redis-based distributed rate limiting with Lua scripts for atomicity
- ✓ Local fallback rate limiting when Redis unavailable
- ✓ Efficient token bucket algorithm implementation
- ✓ Async/await throughout for non-blocking operations
- ✓ Database indexes on frequently queried columns

**Concerns:**
- ⚠️ No connection pooling configuration evident for Redis
- ⚠️ Rate limiter `wait_for_token` could cause request pile-up under high load
- ⚠️ Usage metrics write on every API call could become database bottleneck
- ⚠️ Missing analysis on performance impact of encryption/decryption on every key access

### Test Coverage Analysis

**What's Tested:**
- ✓ API key manager operations (store, retrieve, delete, validate, encrypt/decrypt)
- ✓ Rate limiter token acquisition and fallback
- ✓ Rate limit status reporting
- ✓ Decorator functionality
- ✓ Model enum values and defaults

**Missing Test Coverage:**
- ✗ No integration tests for complete configuration workflow
- ✗ No tests for ApiConfigurationService orchestration
- ✗ No tests for error handler circuit breaker logic
- ✗ No tests for fallback service mechanisms
- ✗ No tests for monitoring endpoints
- ✗ No tests for configuration import/export
- ✗ No tests for health check accuracy
- ✗ No concurrent load tests for rate limiter accuracy
