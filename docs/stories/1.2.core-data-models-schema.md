## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 (Project Infrastructure Setup):
- SQLAlchemy already configured in backend/main.py with SessionLocal and Base setup
- Database URL configured for both SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod) migration path
- FastAPI application structure established with proper dependency management
- Docker environment operational with all services connected

### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/product/architecture/technology-stack.md]
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI 0.104+ (High performance, automatic OpenAPI, async support)
- **Language (Backend)**: Python 3.11+ (Security tool ecosystem, rapid development)
- **Database (Dev)**: SQLite 3.35+ (Zero configuration, embedded)
- **Database (Prod)**: PostgreSQL 15+ (Scalability, concurrent access)
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis 7.0+ (Task queue, caching, real-time)

### Data Models Specifications
[Source: docs/product/architecture/data-models.md]

**Core Entity Relationships:**
- Project (root entity) → Scans, Hosts, ResearchTasks, Notes
- Host → Services (one-to-many)
- Service → ServiceVulnerability → Vulnerability (many-to-many through junction)
- All entities link to Project for proper data isolation

**Key Model Fields:**
- **Project**: id (UUID), name, description, created_at, updated_at, metadata (JSONB)
- **Scan**: id (UUID), project_id (FK), filename, tool_type, status, raw_content, parsed_at, error_details, processing_time_ms
- **Host**: id (UUID), project_id (FK), ip_address (INET), hostname, os_family, os_details, mac_address, status, confidence_score, first_seen, last_seen, metadata (JSONB)
- **Service**: id (UUID), host_id (FK), port (INTEGER), protocol (tcp/udp), service_name, product, version, banner, cpe, confidence
- **Vulnerability**: id (UUID), cve_id, cvss_score (DECIMAL), severity (critical/high/medium/low/info), description, remediation, exploit_available (BOOLEAN), references (JSONB), cisa_kev (BOOLEAN)

### Database Schema Details
[Source: docs/product/architecture/database-schema.md]

**SQLite/PostgreSQL Compatibility:**
- Use UUID primary keys with `gen_random_uuid()` (PostgreSQL) / equivalent for SQLite
- JSONB fields for metadata and references (PostgreSQL native, JSON for SQLite)
- INET type for IP addresses (PostgreSQL native, TEXT for SQLite)
- Proper indexes on: project_id, ip_address, port, cve_id, severity
- Cascade delete: ON DELETE CASCADE for child records when parent deleted

**Required Constraints:**
- UNIQUE(project_id, ip_address) on hosts table
- UNIQUE(host_id, port, protocol) on services table
- Proper foreign key relationships with cascading behavior
- NOT NULL constraints on essential fields

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/product/architecture/api-specification.md]

**Required Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/projects` - Create new project
- `GET /api/v1/projects` - List all projects
- `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/hosts` - List project hosts
- `GET /api/v1/hosts/{host_id}/services` - List host services
- `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/vulnerabilities` - List project vulnerabilities
- All endpoints return JSON with proper HTTP status codes
- List endpoints should support pagination
- Error responses follow consistent format

### File Locations
Based on project structure and development workflow:
- **Models**: `backend/models/` directory with individual model files
- **Database**: `backend/database/` for connection, session management
- **Repositories**: `backend/repositories/` for data access layer
- **API Routes**: `backend/api/` for FastAPI router definitions
- **Migrations**: `backend/alembic/` for database migration files
- **Main App**: Update `backend/main.py` to include new routers

### Migration System Configuration
[Source: docs/product/architecture/development-workflow.md]
- Alembic 1.8+ for database migrations
- Migration environment in `backend/alembic/`
- Command: `alembic upgrade head` for applying migrations
- Support both SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod) environments
- Auto-generation of migration scripts from model changes

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/product/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Backend Testing Standards:**
- **Test Location**: `tests/` directory in backend
- **Framework**: pytest for all backend tests
- **Model Testing**: Test model creation, relationships, constraints
- **Repository Testing**: Test CRUD operations, edge cases, transactions
- **API Testing**: Test endpoint responses, error handling, validation
- **Database Testing**: Use pytest fixtures with test database
- **Sample Test Structure**:
  ```python
  # tests/test_models.py
  def test_host_model_creation():
      host = Host(ip_address="192.168.1.1", project_id="uuid")
      assert host.ip_address == "192.168.1.1"

  # tests/test_repositories.py
  def test_host_repository_create(db_session):
      repo = HostRepository(db_session)
      host = repo.create({"ip_address": "192.168.1.1"})
      assert host.id is not None
  ```

### Technical Constraints
[Source: Architecture documents]
- **Database Compatibility**: Code must work with both SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Performance**: Proper indexing for queries on IP addresses, ports, CVE IDs
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints with proper cascade behavior
- **Security**: No SQL injection vulnerabilities, use parameterized queries
- **Async Support**: Use async/await pattern for database operations where beneficial

### Project Structure Notes
Current backend has minimal structure (only main.py). Need to create:
- `backend/models/` for SQLAlchemy model definitions
- `backend/database/` for connection and session management
- `backend/repositories/` for data access layer
- `backend/api/` for API route definitions
- `backend/alembic/` for database migrations
All paths align with expected project structure from architecture docs.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT**

The implementation demonstrates strong software engineering practices with proper separation of concerns, repository pattern implementation, and comprehensive test coverage. The database schema is well-designed with appropriate constraints, relationships, and indexes. All 7 acceptance criteria have been fully met with high-quality code.

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Clean repository pattern separating data access from business logic
- ✅ Proper SQLAlchemy model design with relationships and cascade behavior
- ✅ Comprehensive unique constraints preventing data duplication
- ✅ Transaction management with proper rollback on errors
- ✅ Good test coverage at both unit and integration levels (12 tests, all passing)
- ✅ Proper FastAPI endpoint structure with validation and error handling
- ✅ Alembic migrations properly configured for schema versioning
- ✅ Database compatibility layer for SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Missing comprehensive docstrings and module-level documentation
- Could benefit from additional cascade delete integration tests
- Some files lack explanatory comments about their purpose

### Refactoring Performed

During the review, I identified and fixed two critical issues:

- **File**: `backend/requirements.txt`
  - **Change**: Upgraded SQLAlchemy from 2.0.23 to 2.0.36
  - **Why**: SQLAlchemy 2.0.23 is incompatible with Python 3.13.7, causing runtime errors when importing models
  - **How**: This upgrade ensures compatibility with the Python 3.13 runtime while maintaining all functionality
  - **Severity**: HIGH - Tests could not run without this fix

- **File**: `backend/models/base.py`
  - **Change**: Updated `declarative_base` import from `sqlalchemy.ext.declarative` to `sqlalchemy.orm`
  - **Why**: The old import path is deprecated in SQLAlchemy 2.0+
  - **How**: This eliminates the deprecation warning and uses the modern import path
  - **Severity**: LOW - Cosmetic improvement, prevents future deprecation issues

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ (No formal document exists, but code follows Python/FastAPI best practices)
- **Project Structure**: ✓ (Matches architecture specifications perfectly)
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ (Follows pytest patterns with fixtures, proper test organization)
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ (All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested)
