### API Specifications
[Source: docs/product/architecture.md#api-specification]
- Health check endpoint: `/health` should return `{"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}`
- API base URL: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`
- Backend should run on port 8000
- Frontend should run on port 3000

### Docker Configuration
[Source: docs/product/architecture.md#development-workflow]
- Use SQLite for development database
- Include Redis for caching/queue (port 6379)
- Backend volumes: ./backend:/app
- Frontend volumes: ./frontend/web-app:/app, /app/node_modules
- Environment variables: DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, API configuration

### File Locations
Based on project structure and architecture:
- Backend code: `backend/` directory with main FastAPI app
- Frontend code: `frontend/web-app/` directory
- CLI tool: `cli/hermes-cli/` directory
- Docker configs: `infrastructure/docker/` directory
- Docker Compose: `docker-compose.yml` in project root
- Environment config: `.env.example` in project root

### Project Structure Notes
Current project has only documentation structure. The monorepo directories (backend/, frontend/, cli/, shared/, infrastructure/) need to be created as this is the foundation setup story.

### Testing
[Source: Architecture docs indicate testing strategy to be defined]
No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs for infrastructure setup. Focus on manual verification that services start and endpoints respond correctly.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: GOOD with MINOR GAPS**

The infrastructure setup demonstrates solid implementation of the monorepo structure with proper Docker containerization. All critical services are configured and operational. The implementation follows industry best practices for containerized development environments. However, there are some minor gaps in configuration completeness and testing coverage.

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM**
- Infrastructure foundation is stable
- Missing .env.example file creates onboarding friction (AC 4 gap)
- No automated tests for infrastructure verification
- Manual testing approach adequate for initial setup

### Requirements Traceability

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**
1. ✅ **AC1: Monorepo structure** - All required directories created (backend/, frontend/, cli/, shared/, infrastructure/)
2. ✅ **AC2: Docker Compose configuration** - All services configured (FastAPI, React, Redis, PostgreSQL)
3. ✅ **AC3: SQLite database connection** - Properly configured in backend/main.py
4. ✅ **AC4: Basic FastAPI health check** - Endpoint returns correct JSON response
5. ✅ **AC5: React TypeScript app** - "Hello Hermes" page with Tailwind CSS implemented
6. ✅ **AC6: Single docker-compose up** - Services orchestrated correctly

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ Python and TypeScript code follows conventions
- **Project Structure**: ✅ Matches architecture specification exactly
- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠️ No automated tests implemented (manual verification only)
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ All acceptance criteria satisfied

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

**Security**: PASS
- Environment variables used for sensitive configuration
- Database credentials isolated to Docker network
- No hardcoded secrets in code

**Performance**: PASS
- Lightweight Alpine images for Redis and PostgreSQL
- Volume mounts for development hot-reload
- Appropriate resource allocation

**Reliability**: CONCERNS
- No health check configurations in docker-compose.yml
- Missing restart policies for services
- No error handling in CLI tool

**Maintainability**: PASS
- Clear project structure
- Proper separation of concerns
- Good documentation in README.md

### Testability Evaluation

**Controllability**: ✅ Good - Services can be started/stopped independently
**Observability**: ⚠️ Limited - No logging configuration or monitoring
**Debuggability**: ✅ Good - Volume mounts allow real-time code changes

### Technical Debt Identified

1. **Missing .env.example file** - Referenced in README but not created
2. **No infrastructure tests** - Manual verification only
3. **Basic error handling** - CLI tool lacks robust error management
4. **No service health checks** - Docker Compose missing healthcheck configurations

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Create .env.example file with all required environment variables (COMPLETED by QA)
- [x] Add healthcheck configurations to docker-compose.yml services (COMPLETED by QA)
- [ ] Implement basic infrastructure tests (smoke tests) - Future story
- [x] Add restart policies to services (restart: unless-stopped) (COMPLETED by QA)
- [x] Enhance CLI error handling with proper exception management (COMPLETED by QA)
- [ ] Add logging configuration to backend service - Future enhancement
- [ ] Consider adding docker-compose.override.yml for local development - Future enhancement

### Security Review

No critical security issues found. Recommendations:
- Add network segmentation between frontend and database
- Consider using secrets management for production credentials
- Add CORS configuration to FastAPI for production

### Performance Considerations

Current setup is appropriate for development. For production consider:
- Multi-stage Docker builds to reduce image size
- Production-optimized configurations
- Resource limits in docker-compose

### Files Modified During Review

**Files improved by QA on 2025-09-29:**
- `.env.example` - Created with comprehensive environment variables
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added health checks and restart policies for all services
- `cli/hermes-cli/hermes.py` - Enhanced error handling with decorator pattern
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Added curl for health check support
- `frontend/web-app/Dockerfile` - Added curl for health check support

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-infrastructure-setup.yml

The infrastructure foundation is solid and ready for building upon. Minor improvements recommended but not blocking.

### Recommended Status

✅ **Ready for Done** - All acceptance criteria met. Minor improvements can be addressed in future stories.
